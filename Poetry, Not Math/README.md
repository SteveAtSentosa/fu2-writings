# Poetry, Not Math

You are about to embark on change.  A change in how you feel about taking care of yourself.  Everything else flows from there.

Please do not consider this to be an instruction manual. Instruction feels like math. We are not looking for math.  You will not be given formulas.  You will be offered a loose framework along with ideas that I have found to be effective.  You will be exploring and finding what works for you, with some help.  Consider this to be an invitation to reflect upon these ideas while looking for connections to your own life.  Finding connections furthers change.

These writings are meant to be read slowly and thoughtfully.  I have endeavored to embed insight into each and every sentence.  If you read a something that strikes you, pause for a moment and look inward.  Explore the idea deeply and think about what it means to you personally.  Finding your own meaning furthers change.

My hope is that this process of reflection and change will be uplifting and ongoing. My hope is that it will feel like poetry.  We are looking for poetry.

### Connecting

I encourage you to pause and think about the above writings.  Write a sentence or two exploring what the following means to you and why it might be important: *Taking care of myself should feel like poetry, not math*

### Steve Notes

I recall reading an article citing research showing a correlation between weight loss success and attaching some form of spiritual significance to the effort, hence the poetry metaphor.  I personally am working on associating weight loss and health with the idea of building a vibrant life.  I journal many mornings, during which time  I endeavor to unplug from the demands of life for a few minutes and explore what finding health means to me.  This often comes with warm feelings.  This, to me is a spiritual connection of sorts that I work on nurturing.  This feels like poetry to me.
